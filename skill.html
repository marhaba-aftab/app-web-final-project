        <p> I entered the field of tailoring, a delicate and detailed profession, but not something I truly loved. At first, I always wished my teacher wouldnot show up. I felt like I was “fighting” with the needle and thread and told myself:
        “I didnot want you; I wanted books and knowledge.”
        Yet today, I have become a skilled tailor.</p>

        <p> To turn my dreams into reality,I joined English classes. I was very weak at first— I used to write sentences before speaking them. But now I can speak well, and I am expected to graduate in February 2026.</p>

        <p> I attended a training center in the heart of a forest. I prepared myself every day with a special outfit and went there with excitement. Six months passed so quickly that I did not even feel time move, and on graduation day, I celebrated with a table full of foods.</p>

      <h1>A BRIEF STORY OF MY LIFE</h1>

        <p>My parents created a beautiful childhood for me— a time that still lives vividly in my memory.
        As a child, I was restless, emotional, and easily upset, yet in every picture and video, I always held a book and a pen. I didnot know what I wrote back then; I just felt peace when they were beside me</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row-one">
        <img src="images/wrting.png" alt="a girl write home work">
        <p>My first day of school was full of excitement. Every year I counted the days, dreaming of reaching 12th grade. My passion grew so strong that I took an exam and moved directly from grade one to grade two, starting fresh with new classmates.</p>
       </div>


        <div class="row-one">
          <img src="images/sdf.png" alt="a girl wear gradjuation">
        <p> I studied until grade nine, but the situation in the country darkened the future of our generation. I fought hard for my dreams, but in a land where the gun is stronger than the pen, justice belongs to the one holding the weapon, not the one holding the book.</p>
       </div>

        <div class="row-one">
          <img src="images/book123.jpg" alt="book and dancer">
        <p>Yet I never danced to the “song of the gunman.”
        Like a bird who still dreams of flying even inside a cage,
        and like a parrot who does not stay silent in captivity—
        I chose not to give up.
        And today, despite everything, I carry a world of achievements.
